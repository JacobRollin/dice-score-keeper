# Dice Game Score Keeper
### A Project by Jacob Rollin

This project aims to do a few things:
* Keep score for a dice game that is popular among my family
* Allow me to practice python for a real world application
* Make it so nobody has to do anymore math when we play

## Features
* Select a number of players between 2 and 6 (can be easily changed)
* Enter player names
* Keep track of total player score by simply entering their turn score
* Put the game into "Final Roll Mode" automatically when somebody has gone over the score limit

## Planned Features
This project currently doesn't have any planned features. Right now I'm working on simplifying the code and correcting bugs. In the future I may try to add some addtional functionality like setting the turn order seperately from the order that names are entered, or adding an undo function to correct mistakes. Eventually I'd also like to create a better UI as this project currently just runs in the terminal.
